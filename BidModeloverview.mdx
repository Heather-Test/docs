# Bid Model overview 

No two campaigns are the same. Monitoring real-time performance and continually refining your strategy are crucial to ensure every dollar is spent efficiently—but this presents a challenge when you’re managing several campaigns simultaneously. 

A Bid Model is a high-performance machine that you can steer to optimize your campaigns. You create a set of rules that the Bid Model deploys as the campaign runs. With intuitive controls, you can adjust bids with [Bid Modifiers](https://iqm-197a61a3.mintlify.app/BidModifieroverview), allocate budgets with [Spend Ratios](https://iqm-197a61a3.mintlify.app/SpendRatiooverview), and define priorities with [Dimension Priorities](https://iqm-197a61a3.mintlify.app/DimensionPriorityoverview) to optimize performance in real time. 

# Bid Model eligibility requirements

All advertisers can manage Bid Model components for their campaigns; however, a campaign must meet certain conditions before it becomes eligible. These conditions differ based on the individual [Bid Model component](https://iqm-197a61a3.mintlify.app/BidModeloverview#bid-model-components) that you’d like to apply. 

Refer to these resources for more information on component-level eligibility requirements:

* [Spend Ratio eligibility requirements](https://iqm-197a61a3.mintlify.app/SpendRatiooverview#spend-ratio-eligibility-requirements)&#x20;

* [Dimension Priority eligibility requirements](https://iqm-197a61a3.mintlify.app/DimensionPriorityoverview#dimension-priority-eligibility-requirements)&#x20;

* [Bid Modifier eligibility requirements](https://iqm-197a61a3.mintlify.app/BidModifieroverview#bid-modifier-eligibility-requirements)&#x20;

Campaigns support Bid Modeling on up to 100 dimension values. 

# Bid Model components 

When you apply a Bid Model setting, you define rules across one or more Bid Model components for a particular [dimension](https://iqm-197a61a3.mintlify.app/BidModeloverview#supported-dimensions). These components include Spend Ratios, Dimension Priorities, and Bid Modifiers. The Bid Model also includes the option to add individual dimensions to a campaign’s Allowlist or Blocklist when those dimensions appear in the campaign’s ad-serving data. 

While these granular adjustments are optional, they allow you to take greater control of your campaign’s optimizations and, ultimately, its performance. 

* **Spend Ratio:** Specify how much of a campaign’s total budget you’d like to allocate to each dimension. 

* **Dimension Priority:** Define the order in which a campaign should attempt to deliver impressions. 

* **Bid Modifier:** Choose which targeting dimensions are more valuable or less valuable for the campaign, and define how much you’re willing to spend on them. 

* **Allowlist/Blocklist:** Block or enable ad serving for individual dimensions that have appeared in the ad-serving data. 

Refer to [Spend Ratio overview](https://iqm-197a61a3.mintlify.app/SpendRatiooverview), [Dimension Priority overview](https://iqm-197a61a3.mintlify.app/DimensionPriorityoverview), and [Bid Modifier overview](https://iqm-197a61a3.mintlify.app/BidModifieroverview) for more information about these individual Bid Model components. 

# Supported dimensions

Dimensions are the different targeting parameters that you can adjust by applying one or more [Bid Model components](https://iqm-197a61a3.mintlify.app/BidModeloverview#bid-model-components) to them. Bid Modeling is supported across the **Creative**, **Location**, and **Inventory** dimension categories.  

<Warning>
  **Dimension category notice:** Bid Modeling can be applied to one **dimension subcategory** at a time for each **dimension category**. For example, you can set Bid Model settings for a list of Creative IDs, States, and Deal IDs; but not Creative IDs, States, ZIP Codes, and Deal IDs.  
</Warning>

| Dimension category | Dimension subcategory                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Creative**       | Creative ID                                |
| **Location**       | State, City, ZIP Code                      |
| **Inventory**      | Open Exchange, Publisher Category, Deal ID |

# Key terms and concepts

## Applying multiple Bid Model components 

Bid Model components can be applied individually or together. When you apply multiple settings for the same dimension, ad opportunities pass through a decision-making process. 

The Bid Model engine assesses whether serving is enabled for a dimension at each stage. This assessment is based on the Bid Model settings you defined and the campaign’s current performance. Once the campaign confirms that the ad opportunity matches every campaign and Bid Model setting for that particular dimension, it places a bid in the programmatic auction.

## Campaign Bidding Insights report

In certain cases, the granular campaign rules that you apply via Bid Model settings can begin to limit the number of bids that your campaign places in programmatic auctions. If a campaign featuring Spend Ratios, Dimension Priorities, and/or Bid Modifiers is not performing as expected, we recommend generating a Campaign Bidding Insights report for it. The report highlights which targeting parameters are limiting the campaign’s number of bid requests, which you can use to apply strategic optimizations and increase scale.
